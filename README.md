# Hey there! 👋 I'm Aadhar Mishra

## About Me
Automation QA professional with 5+ years of experience, specializing in making manual testing feel as obsolete as floppy disks. I harness advanced AI models to automate processes, reducing manual efforts so I can spend more time on ☕ coffee breaks (or coding, I guess).

## Skills 🛠️
- **Languages:** Java, Python (no, not the snake 🐍)
- **Tools:** Selenium, Playwright (because clicking buttons manually is so last century)
- **Frameworks:** TestNG, JUnit, Maven (the trifecta of test automation)
- **Tech:** REST APIs, Apache POI (not to be confused with my cooking skills 🍳)
- **Concepts:** OOP, POM, and a sprinkle of Machine Learning magic ✨

## Projects 🚀
- **[AI-Powered Bug Report Enhancement Tool](link-to-your-project)**: A tool that transforms bug reports into polished prose—because nobody likes a grammar mistake. ✏️
- **[Jira Bug Filing Automation](link-to-your-project)**: Reduced manual efforts by 80%—now I can finally catch up on my favorite shows! 📺
